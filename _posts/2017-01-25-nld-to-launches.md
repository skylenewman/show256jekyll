For New Leaf Digital, we thought that it would be helpful to have our own short URL, where we could provide easy links to members, sponsors, and presenters.  Once I saw that [bit.ly](http://bit.ly) Enterprise cost [$995 per month](https://www.quora.com/How-much-do-vanity-URL-shorteners-cost) for vanity URLS, I thought that I could find a better solution.

To begin with, I bought the URL nld.to.

I found [YOURLS](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS), which is a PHP/MySQL-based URL shortener.  I already had an [Amazon Lightsail](https://amazonlightsail.com) Ubuntu box that was idle ($5 per month), so I set it up on there.

As a note, the YOURLS software does not create a homepage (index.php), so if you visit, there will be errors.  If you instead visit:

* [http://nld.to/cwn](http://nld.to/cwn) (CoWorking Night)
* [http://nld.to/3210](http://nld.to/3210) (32/10 Young Professionals)
* [http://nld.to/donate](http://nld.to/donate) (Donate to New Leaf!)

The only major thing that I ran into was that there were errors creating a few of the tables with MariaDB on 16.04.  I worked through the issue by following this [Github Issue](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/issues/2125), in particular the following command got the tables to create properly.:

{% highlight sql %}
MariaDB [yourlsdb]> CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS yourls_url (keyword varchar(200) BINARY NOT NULL,url text BINARY NOT NULL,title text CHARACTER SET utf8,timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,ip VARCHAR(41) NOT NULL,clicks INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (keyword), KEY timestamp (timestamp), KEY ip (ip))
-> ENGINE=MyISAM;
{% endhighlight %}
